Users highlighted the cyber breach on Reddit and Twitter Wednesday, with some saying they could lose hundreds of dollars. NiceHash lets people offer computing capacity for bitcoin miners to mine digital currencies. Cryptocurrency miners work out complex mathematical equations to add cryptocurrency transactions to decentralized public ledgers called blockchains. The mining marketplace initially said its service was undergoing maintenance on Twitter, later adding it was working hard to resolve issues affecting the site. NiceHash said in a statement it was investigating the nature of the incident, and that it would close down its site for a day. We are working to verify the precise number of BTC (bitcoin) taken, the company said. Clearly, this is a matter of deep concern and we are working hard to rectify the matter in the coming days.In addition to undertaking our own investigation, the incident has been reported to the relevant authorities and law enforcement and we are co-operating with them as a matter of urgency. While NiceHash was unable to specify how much bitcoin had been stolen, users have pointed to a bitcoin wallet which holds 4,736.42 bitcoins — equivalent to $68 million. Andrej P. Skraba, head of marketing at the firm, confirmed to news agency Reuters that around 4,700 bitcoins — worth roughly $68 million at current prices — were lost in the hack. CNBC reached out to NiceHash Chief Executive Marko Kobal for comment but he was not available at the time of publication. This wouldnt be the first time people have lost millions in cryptocurrency. In November, millions of dollars worth of Ethereum were accidentally frozen on the cryptocurrency wallet provider Parity after a user suicided the wallet, deleting its code and freezing all ether tokens contained within.', 'https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2017/09/19/104719606-GettyImages-843200022.1910x1000.jpg?v=1505864389', 1);

He is to be sentenced Dec. 6 and could face a seven-year prison sentence, according to his plea agreement. DETROIT — A federal court judge in Detroit sentenced a former Volkswagen manager Wednesday to seven years in prison and ordered him to pay $400,000 in the companys massive diesel emissions cheating scandal, but Judge Sean Cox made clear that justice has not yet been served. Cox described the ex-manager, Oliver Schmidt, as an opportunist and a significant player in Volkswagens attempted coverup. But he also noted that "senior management has not been held accountable" in a case that has hurt both consumers who thought they were getting a good product and blue-collar and middle-management workers at VW. He said the VW case "attacks and destroys" the foundation of the countrys economic system — the trust between buyers and sellers. Cox had harsh words for Schmidt, seeing no excuses for the highly educated mechanical engineer. He doesnt suffer from the substance abuse common among criminals, comes from a good family and was well-off financially, with a $130,000 base salary, $40,000 annual bonuses and a net worth of $1 million. "You saw this attempted coverup of this massive fraud in the United States as an opportunity to impress senior management at VW and therefore advance your career at VW," Cox told Schmidt.', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/10/business/10VOLKSWAGEN2/10VOLKSWAGEN2-master768.jpg', 3);

And he was the hero again in Wednesdays 101-95 victory over the Sacramento Kings to give the current Cavs their 13th straight triumph, tying the franchise record he helped set years ago. Only this time around, hes doing more of his damage from beyond the 3-point arc, punctuating his improved shooting this season with a trey with 16.6 seconds left to grow the Cavs lead from 2 to 5 and effectively end the Kings night. The 3 was James fifth of the night. He went 5-for-8 from deep -- even better than his sharpshooting teammate Kyle Korver, who went 4-for-8 -- to lift his 3-point shooting average to 43.0 percent for the season, a career high. The previous best mark for the 15-year veteran was 40.6 percent in 2012-13 with the Miami Heat. When the Cavs were off to those win streaks in 2009 and 2010, James shot 34.4 and 33.3 percent from deep, respectively. I just wanted to continue to improve my game, James said of his increased marksmanship this season. I try to get better and better each and every year, and shooting the ball is what this league has kind of turned into, so for me to continue to improve, thats what I wanted to do. I put a lot of work into my offseason training and I just try to implement it into the season once it gets here. Two-time MVP Stephen Curry, widely credited for the 3-point revolution that the entire NBA has embraced, is shooting 38.1 percent from 3 this season, for comparisons sake. It was James ninth game this season with three made 3s or more out of 25 games. Last season, James hit three 3s or more 17 times in 74 games. His dagger 3 on Wednesday came on the same playcall that freed James up for a game-winning 21-foot corner jumper in Game 4 of the 2015 Eastern Conference semifinals against the Chicago Bulls to knot the series 2-2. That play, which James revealed came to be after he scratched the original plan that former Cavs coach David Blatt had drawn up with 1.5 seconds left that would have had James passing the ball in from underneath the hoop rather than shooting it, has since been dubbed Chicago by the Cavs coaching staff. Coming out of a timeout with 20.6 seconds left in the fourth quarter and clinging to a two-point lead against the Kings, James asked for Chicago again. Was going to run a different play, and then Bron said, I want Chicago. So I said, OK, said Cavs coach Tyronn Lue. We got it to him and he made a big shot. That was a huge play for us to put us up five.', 'http://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F1206%2Fr299550_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg&w=570', 4);

This newfound giant black hole, which formed just 690 million years after the Big Bang, could one day help shed light on a number of cosmic mysteries, such as how black holes could have reached gargantuan sizes quickly after the Big Bang and how the universe got cleared of the murky fog that once filled the entire cosmos, the researchers said in the new study. Supermassive black holes with masses millions to billions of times that of the sun are thought to lurk at the hearts of most, if not all, galaxies. Previous research suggested these giants release extraordinarily large amounts of light when they rip apart stars and devour matter, and likely are the driving force behind quasars, which are among the brightest objects in the universe. [The Strangest Black Holes in the Universe] Astronomers can detect quasars from the farthest corners of the cosmos, making quasars among the most distant objects known. The farthest quasars are also the earliest known quasars — the more distant one is, the more time its light took to reach Earth. The previous record for the earliest, most distant quasar was set by ULAS J1120+0641. That quasar is located 13.04 billion light-years from Earth and existed about 750 million years after the Big Bang. The newfound quasar (and its black hole), named ULAS J1342+0928, is 13.1 billion light-years away. Explaining how black holes could have gobbled up enough matter to reach supermassive sizes early in cosmic history has proved extraordinarily challenging for scientists. As such, researchers want to look at as many early supermassive black holes as possible to learn more about their growth and their effects on the rest of the cosmos. The most distant quasars can provide key insights to outstanding questions in astrophysics, said study lead author Eduardo Bañados, an astrophysicist at the Carnegie Institution for Science. The researchers predicted that only 20 to 100 quasars as bright and as distant as the newfound quasar exist in the whole sky visible from Earth. This particular quasar is so bright that it will become a gold mine for follow-up studies and will be a crucial laboratory to study the early universe, Bañados told Space.com. We have already secured observations for this object with a number of the most powerful telescopes in the world. More surprises may arise. The researchers detected and analyzed quasar ULAS J1342+0928 using one of the Magellan Telescopes at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile, as well as the Large Binocular Telescope in Arizona and the Gemini North telescope in Hawaii. Its central black hole has a mass about 800 million times that of the sun and existed when the universe was just 690 million years old, or just 5 percent of its current age. [No Escape: The Anatomy of a Black Hole (Infographic)] All that mass — almost 1 billion times the mass of the sun — needs to be gathered in less than 690 million years, Bañados said. That is extremely difficult to achieve and is something that theorists will need to explain in their models. Quasars like J1342+0928 are rare. The researchers searched one-tenth of the entire sky visible from Earth and found just one quasar from this early epoch. Only about 60 million years separate this newfound quasar from the previous record holder. Still, this span of time was about 10 percent of the age of the universe at those early cosmic epochs, when things were evolving very rapidly, Bañados said. That means this difference in time could yield important clues about the evolution of the early universe. This new quasar is also of interest to scientists because it comes from a time known as the epoch of reionization, when the universe emerged from its dark ages. It was the universes last major transition and one of the current frontiers of astrophysics, Bañados said in a statement. Right after the Big Bang, the universe was a rapidly expanding hot soup of ions, or electrically charged particles. About 380,000 years later, these ions cooled and coalesced into neutral hydrogen gas. The universe stayed dark until gravity pulled matter together into the first stars. The intense ultraviolet light from this era caused this murky neutral hydrogen to get excited and ionize, or gain electric charge, and the gas has remained in that state since that time. Once the universe became reionized, light could travel freely through space. Much remains unknown about the epoch of reionization, such as what sources of light caused reionization. Some prior work suggested that massive stars were mostly responsible for reionization, but other research hinted that black holes were a significant, and potentially dominant, culprit behind this event. [7 Surprising Things About the Universe] How and when the reionization of the universe occurred has fundamental implications on how the universe evolved, Bañados said. The new findings revealed that a large fraction of the hydrogen in the immediate vicinity of the newfound quasar was neutrally charged. This suggests that this quasar comes from well within the epoch of reionization, and further analysis of it could yield insight into what happened during this pivotal time. However, to really learn more about the epoch of reionization, scientists need more than just one or two early, distant quasars to look at. We need to find more of these quasars at similar or larger distances, Bañados said. This is extremely difficult, as they are very rare. This is really like finding the needle in a haystack. Still, the fact that this newfound quasar is so bright and large suggests that its probably not the first quasar ever formed, so we need to keep searching, Bañados said. The scientists detailed their findings in the Dec. 7 issue of the journal Nature. The researchers also released a companion paper in The Astrophysical Journal Letters. Follow Charles Q.
